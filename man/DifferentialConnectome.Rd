\usage{
DifferentialConnectome(connect.ref, connect.test, min.pct = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{connect.ref}{A connectome from a system}

\item{connect.test}{A connectome from a different system, to be compared to connect.ref}

\item{min.pct}{Default 0.1. Threshold to return clusterwise observations for both ligand and receptor. Only needs to be satisfied in connect.ref OR in connect.test.}
}
\description{
Currently in beta testing. Creates a fold-change connectome from two input connectomes, generally unfiltered.  Must be node-aligned, from the same reference mapping, and unfiltered. ('edge' columns must contain identical entries, though not necessarily in the same order.)
