\usage{
LigandDotPlot(connectome, NOI, return = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{connectome}{A connectomic edgelist}

\item{NOI}{The nodes of interest to include in the network analysis and subsequent plotting}
}
\description{
This function takes a connectomic edgelist and creates a source and a sink LIGAND- and cell- organized dot plot. The y-axis is binned by ligand,
and the x-axis is the sum of the weight of all edges for each ligand made by each cell. Points are binned by cell type, with the size of the point
correlating to the Kleinberg hub score (for source graph) and Kleinberg authority score (for sink graph)
